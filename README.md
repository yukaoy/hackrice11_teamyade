Google Chrome Extension: StudyFish

How many times as a student were you asked before a test: how long did you study?  Often time, I was either too lost in studying or too tired to really know the answer and would just guess at the number.  This program is designed to aid with keeping track of total time spent studying during a study session.

Often times when studying, students stop to check their phones or take long breaks.  Sometimes, when the time comes to stop studying, it is difficult to even know how long you were actually studying for!

Our chrome extension is an asthetic, easy to use, stopwatch that allows the student to know exactly how much time was spent studying.  When a studnet starts studying, they start the timer.  When a student takes a break, they simply pause the stopwatch and restart it when they restart.  This allows for easy, in brower, time management.

Furthermore, the program comes with a satisfying user interface that rewards time spent studying.  When the timer starts, the student's fish is lonely in its tank.  However, every 20 minutes, the fish gets items added to its aquarium and gets progressively more happy.  At the end of the two hours, the fish is content and the student's study session is over.  If the student wishes to stop studying or wants to start tracking hours for another class, the reset button can be used.

Finally, this app has tons of future possibility.  For example, a feature that allows a student to designate which class they are studying for and track total hours spent.  Also, different themes could be added for further asthetic customization.
